# Shortest Path Visualizer

A dynamic web application built using **React.js** to visualize the shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall) on a grid. Users can interact with the grid, select nodes, edges, and compute the shortest path between selected nodes. The application provides a clear and intuitive visual representation of the shortest path in red, and supports multiple algorithm selection.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Users can click on grid cells to create nodes.
- **Node and Edge Management**: Create and remove nodes and define weighted edges between them.
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Supports **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** to find the shortest path between two selected nodes.
- **Path Visualization**: The shortest path is visualized on the grid with red-colored edges.
- **Responsive Design**: The application adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **State Management**: React State
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for grid and node designs
- **Algorithms**: Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall algorithms implemented in JavaScript
